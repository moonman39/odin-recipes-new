# odin-recipes-new

This project is part of the foundations path of The Odin Project.  

In essence, this project will be a way to put all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far into practice.  I'll be building a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
